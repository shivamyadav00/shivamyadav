# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I am current a student at the University of Michigan pursuing a Master of Science in Applied Statistics. I have a Bachelor of Science, Engineering (BSE) in Data Science. Some of my favorite classes to date have been information retrieval, theoretical probability, machine learning, and data mining. I am also an avid chef: feel free to follow my instagram @shivamthechef to stay up to date my my latest plant-based creations.
